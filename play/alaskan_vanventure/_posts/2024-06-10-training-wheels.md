There is a current to the society which we live. Whether you are aware of it or not, this current pulls you in a direction. The current is
why you get a degree. It is the invisible force that tells you to get married, have kids, and adopt a dog. There was a time when the current
was so deeply embedded in our psyche that was given a name. The American Dream. It sounds so magical. Achieve this an you are set for life.
Go with the flow and you will have it all. The collective dream come true. Whit picket fences, money, a legacy. Just ride the current, don't
ask questions and you can have it all.

The current is strong. It's waters are deep.

Being a nomad is like being an interstellar explorer. Just as a spaceship breaks free from the Earth's gavitational pull so does the nomad
evacuate the under tow of the current. However, unlike the astronaut, the nomad doesn't benefit from a team of reasearchers estimating and
calculating all of the scenarios of their journey. The nomad builds their ship as they fly it.

"We won't make it" This one said "We are on day 4 and there is less than 25% left on our power bank. We won't make it another 3 days."

"We will need to land somewhere to charge up." Answered That one.

"Land." That was the term they used when they talked about stopping at a campground or an RV park. A place that they could plug in, fill up
and reload. Landing often meant they were wedged into a space twice the width of a parking space alongside 5th wheels and travel trailers.
folks dependent on the grid for their needs. The space-craft equivalent to being grounded. In short; The last place they wanted to be.

This was their routine for a month after leaving Texas. 3 days off grid 4 days on grid. Take off into the woods but be home in time for dinner. This was
not ideal. This was not what was promised. Something was broken.

This one said to That one, "I think we need to take Heyvan in for an upgrade. Possibly a repair. If we are going to be in the wilds of
Alaska we need to be more self sufficient." To which That one nodded her head in agreement.

As luck would have it a van technician was only a short detour from their current course. If you consider a 2 state and 3 day's drive a
short detour. Never the less they made an appointment and once again reset the compass for the mile high city; Denver, Colorado.

For our heroes Denver acted as their training ground. No longer were they held aloft by the safety net of driveway surfing from friend to
family. They were on their own. Well, sort of. That one had a relative in the area and they also had their first gig as traveling pet
sitters. In between those visits they were on their own... well, actually, they connected with a local climbing gym which permitted them to
park and use the facilities. But aside from THAT... they were on their own. In any case, Denver was their chosen port of call where they
intended to level up and prepare themselves for much longer durations off grid.
