Misfit on the trail is an anthology of short stories cataloging my thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail in 2022. The stories where a way to
share my journey with others through the art of storytelling. Each story is losely connected and were published in real time with my hike. I
hope this inspires you to take a hike.
