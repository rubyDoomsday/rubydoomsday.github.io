On September 9 at 9:00 AM, after hiking 2,194.3 miles, through 14 states, for 159 days... destroying 3 pairs of shoes... almost dying
once... losing 3 toenails.... writing several stories... drinking lots of root beer... facing inner demons and real dangers... being eaten
alive by mosquitos... fording 5 rivers... while carrying a 30-pound pack... taking 4 blue blazes... walking 6 miles of road... seeing 1
bear... canoeing 40 miles of the Shenandoah River... climbing more elevation than 50 Mount Everests... hitchhiking 4 times... Oh, and let's
not forget receiving help from countless other hikers, trail angels, friends, family, and acquaintances... I completed my 2022 Northbound
Appalachian Trail thru-hike by summiting Katahdin.
