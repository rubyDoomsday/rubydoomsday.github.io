## Mile 274

Misfit took a few steps to leave but immediately returned to hug her and kiss her goodbye one last time. This goodbye was more challenging
than the first time when she started the hike. This time there were no distractions. No bad weather or cold temperatures insisting they get
moving. It was a beautiful day by any other measure, but that didn't matter because today was the day Misfit had to get back on the trail
after a much-needed two-day rest with her loving partner, Jabberwalker.

In that last embrace, Misfit remembered their fleeting moments of joy over the previous few days. Warm snuggles in a cozy bed. Conversation
shared over delicious food. Seeing Jabberwalker, as if for the first time, Misfit drank in every second, knowing that this parting moment
was inevitably ticking ever closer. It was time. She had to let go and get back on trail, if for no other reason than Jabberwalker had her
own journey ahead of her. Misfit could not force the moment to last longer, no matter how hard she focused. It was time to hike.
“Hiking in,” as they say, is exciting! Like hiking into a new town for the first time. The endless possibilities and promises of sugary
sodas, greasy cheeseburgers, and the coveted spring mattress. “Hiking out,” on the other hand, is awful. The hard truth of a loaded pack
full to the brim with a 4-day resupply. A guarantee that you'll be hiking straight up for 2 miles to get out of town (all towns are indeed
in gaps or valleys).

Right now, Misfit was hiking out of Jabberwalker's arms, which is about as awful as it gets. Even an empty pack feels weighed down when you
have a heavy heart. Feet like lead, pack unbearably heavy on her back, and tears creeping out the corners of her eyes, Misfit made her way
up the hill into the forest. She followed a switchback that presented a clear view of the parking lot and watched as Jabberwalker drove out
of sight. With that, Misfit was back on her own.

The steps came hard at first, much like on her first day. She felt the loss and fear of being on her own once again. Meeting the hard truth
of passing the point of no return. This time, however, she had familiarity with the forest. The trusty white blaze guided her along. First a
mile, then another. Somewhere along the way, it occurred to Misfit that Jabberwalker was no longer behind her. The realization was that if
she turned around at this moment and retraced her steps down the hill, Jabberwalker wouldn't be there. There is no going back when you are
on the trail, only forward. This meant that Jabberwalker was now 200 miles ahead at their next meet-up in Damascus. Misfit started walking
faster; her pack felt lighter because her perspective shifted. She realized she was starting a long hike in... and “hiking in” is exciting!
